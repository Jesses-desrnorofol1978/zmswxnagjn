OMG, you wouldn’t believe the rollercoaster that was Last Bullet! 😂 Where do I even start? It's like they took the script, threw it in a blender, and this is what came out. Seriously, there were moments I could barely keep my eyes open, but then BAM! Something wild would happen, you know what I mean? 

I 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   thinking it’d be a cozy, chill night-in kinda flick, but nooo, right from the start, it’s like you're on this crazy ride. First half was all build-up, I swear I was like, is something gonna happen? But then honestly, that twist—who saw that coming? 👀

>The villain was such a cliché, though — rolling my eyes every time they'd make some cheesy evil speech. And don’t even get me started on the hero's one-liners, cringe-fest 101. But hey, I guess those are half the fun, right? Adds to the charm, haha!

Oh and the ending... was 🤯! I was just sitting there like, wait, what? Did I miss something? Seriously had to rewind. It’s those sorts of  s where after you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , you’re just left with more questions than answers. Like, did they just run out of budget and thought oh well, let's just end it here? 😂

// Excuse my coding brain: const funFactor = Math.random()  100; 

Anyway, now I'm over here lying on my bed, half laughing, half confused about life choices, LOL! So, what about you? What you been up to since yesterday? I need a distraction from this madness!🤣
